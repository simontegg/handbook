# Decision Culture & Practice

While this document defines our formal decision making protocols, the effectiveness of our decision-making practice depends on our collective culture. The following principles have been found to be helpful in supporting formal decision-making at Enspiral.


**Your Participation**

* Share your genuine and honest views and opinions.
* Be succinct and clear in your communication.
* Modulate the volume of your contributions to leave space for equitable participation from others.
* Practice empathy and ask questions. Listen to understand, not to find fault.
* Actively engage in order to help the group make progress.
* Be prepared to have your mind changed - donâ€™t be overly attached to your ideas.
* Consciously embrace diverse perspectives to reveal blind spots.
* Ask for help if you are not adequately engaged or don't understand an issue.

**Enriching Engagement**

* Open multiple channels to get well-rounded input (not just Loomio, not just online).
* Involve people who are not in your geographical location and those you do not work with regularly.
* If you encounter tension, conflict, or confusion, escalate communication to a higher bandwidth channel (Loomio to chat, chat to video, video to one-on-one, one-on-one to mediation by a third party), and then report outcomes back to the group.
* Take considered acts of facilitation to improve the experience of the group overall (examples: inviting in those we have not yet heard from, clarifying and summarising points raised, suggesting good timing for a proposal, etc).
