# Contributing to the handbook

## Edit Permissions 

 * If you don't have edit permissions follow the [Github based workflow](#github-based-workflow)

 * Once a maintainer has merged in your contribution they will make you a handbook maintainer and you will have edit and merge permissions. 

 * If you want to modify an agreement document you will first need to follow the process outlined in the [decisions agreement](http://handbook.enspiral.com/decisions_agreement.html)


## Github based workflow

1. Make sure you have a github account and are signed in.
2. Fork the handbook repository to your own personal account

3. If you know how to clone a repository, do so and modify the files in your local repository and push up the changes to your github repository.

 If you don't, no worries. Just open up the repository in prose.io. The link will be http://prose.io/#[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME/handbook and make your changes there. 
4. Once you're satisfied with your changes create a pull request from your repository to the `enspiral/handbook` repository.

A maintainer will merge your contribution and make you a fellow maintainer. 


## Handbook Maintainers

Handbook maintainers will merge contributions within 1-2 days. As a general guideline a maintainer does not merge in their own branches or pull requests.
