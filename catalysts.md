##Current Catalysts

###Susan Basterfield

Started: April 1, 2016

Stewards: Craig Ambrose, Jessy-Kate Schingler, Alanna Krause

I’m Susan, currently based in a polehouse in Titirangi. I will be serving as a Catalyst 2 days a week, sponsored by Enspiral Services and Enspiral Academy.

My stewards are Craig Ambrose, Jessy-Kate Schingler and Alanna Krause. I am excited and grateful to each of them for taking on this role, and I know they will provide a great balance of perspectives and challenge.

I am also super grateful for the trust Enspiral has placed in me as a new contributor; I hold this opportunity as a tremendous responsibility. I have so much to learn! Please hold me to account.

I’ll be spending a lot of time in Wellington - at least 9 days per month. My personal intention for this work is to live co-leadership; to act in service of and focus on the important work of both understanding the opportunities and collectively addressing issues of scarcity - whether that’s time, resource, or mindset.

I’m really good at listening and providing a fresh perspective, and I’d like to invite you to take me up on that. I’m energized by any mode of engagement, in person or via video, phone, slack, email, postcards... Convene with me!

###Richard Bartlett

Started: April 1, 2016

Stewards: Rose Lu, Bart de Vries, Ben Knight

I'm very suspicious of leadership, authority, named roles, explicit power, implicit power and sorta made-up words like "catalyst". I'm into working in public, creating invitations, taking risks, being reflective, having hard conversations, being considerate, communicating clearly, and dancing with my butt.

I've taken on the Catalyst role to make the work I'm already doing more explicit, so that other people can see how to be proactive and contribute to Enspiral in a sustainable transparent way. My stewards Rose, Bart and Ben are going to help me keep the role well-scoped to get high impact from low hours (1 day per week). I want to demonstrate how you can make a significant contribution to Enspiral without putting in more hours than is healthy.

Loomio is funding my time so my focus is going to be work that is mutually beneficial for Enspiral and Loomio. I'll primarily be doing storytelling + profile raising for Enspiral: open sourcing what we are learning with more people.

My priorities for the 6 months that I have funding for are writing stories and supporting more people to write stories; repping Enspiral and Loomio at sharing economy events in Europe; and supporting OS//OS to be the flagship public event for Enspiral in 2016.

Some metrics that I'll be reporting on:

* number of events
* number of stories we tell
* number of visits, followers
* number of stories other people tell about us

###Joshua Vial

Started: April 1, 2016

Stewards: Simon Tegg, Chelsea Robinson, Genevieve Parkes, Andre Bate

I like about half the things on Rich’s just as much as he does and dislike half the things about half as much. I’ll let you guess which categories ‘dancing with my butt’ and ‘sorta made-up words like “catalyst”’ fall into.

I’m not sure I know how to not catalyse things and I am deeply grateful to Enspiral Academy for sponsoring two days a week so that I actually have time to put into making things better.

My biggest intention is to get my mind out of the way and listen deeply so I can serve as best I can. I hope I am at least twice as effective at the end of this year as I am at the start of it and I intend to give the start everything I have.
